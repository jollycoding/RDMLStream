Region-based Deep Metric Learning for Tackling Class Overlap in Online Semi-Supervised Data Stream Classification

Abstract
Class overlap in data streams presents a significant challenge for real-time classification, particularly when confronted with the high dimensionality and evolving distributions inherent in such streams. Traditional classification methods, typically designed for static datasets, struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of data streams, where both high-dimensional feature spaces and class imbalance exacerbate the complexity of classifying overlapping regions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning framework specifically tailored to address the challenges of class overlap in high-dimensional data streams. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we develop a multi-anchor sample mining mechanism based on neighborhood rough set theory, which partitions the data into non-overlapping and overlapping regions. By utilizing region-specific triplet-margin losses and hinge embedding loss, we construct a more refined discriminative metric space that significantly enhances the separation of overlapping classes. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic, density-aware real-time label propagation mechanism with class-imbalance compensation. This component integrates real-time distribution estimation with a nonlinear adaptive threshold controller, enabling dual adaptivity: (1) dynamically re-weighting density contributions via inverse-frequency scaling to mitigate the dominance of majority classes and (2) adjusting threshold boundaries for frequent classes while relaxing propagation criteria for rare classes through nonlinear adjustments. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that our method not only improves balanced accuracy but also enhances robustness in the presence of class overlap and class imbalance, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
